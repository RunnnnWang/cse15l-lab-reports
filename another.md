* Working directory: ~/lecture1 (which means I am in the lecture1 directory)
* cd changes the directory. My working directory changes to my home directory in this workspace. I got this output because cd without any argument cd will take you back to the home directory. 
* This is not an error. 

## ls without argument

* Working directory: this workspace's home directory
* ls prints the items in the current directory. Since I am in my workspace's home directory and there is only the lecture1 folder in it, lecture1 gets printed.
* This is no error.

## cat without argument
